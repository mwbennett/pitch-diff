There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

  Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.

## Interval Training for Musicians and Composers ##
<!-- > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title. -->
  > Train your eyes and ears to recognize musical intervals quickly and accurately. 

## Summary ##
<!-- > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good. -->
  > PitchDiff helps you improve your ability to quickly and accurately recognize intervals. The app allows you to select whether you'd like to hear the interval played or see the interval written in staff notation. 

## Problem ##
<!--  > Describe the problem your product solves. -->
  > Interval recognition is a key component of musical training, and is challenging to learn without routine practice. The ability to quickly identify intervals offers a distinct advantage for aspiring musicians, composers, and theorists. Interval training is often a pain point for young music students, and the feeling that you cannot practice without an instructor nearby makes development even more difficult. 

## Solution ##
<!-- > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem. -->
  > PitchDiff provides a way to autonomously develop your interval chops and gain confidence in your ability to read and hear intervals accurately. It elminiates the need to practice with another person, thereby alleviating potential discomfort for beginners who are hesitant to practice in front of others. 

## Quote ##
<!-- > A quote from a spokesperson in your company. -->
  > "I studied music for a long time, and I still suck at intervals. PitchDiff will save me."

## How to Get Started ##
<!-- > Describe how easy it is to get started. -->
  > Check out the app at < url here >. 

## Customer Quote ##
<!-- > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit. -->
  >  "I'm a totally real customer who had a real experience with this product that was positive. PitchDiff is disrupting things."

## Closing and Call to Action ##
<!-- > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next. -->
