# PitchDiff #
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). 

## Interval Training for Musicians and Composers ##
<!-- > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title. -->
  > Train your eyes and ears to recognize musical intervals quickly and accurately. 

## Summary ##
<!-- > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good. -->
  > PitchDiff helps you improve your ability to quickly and accurately recognize intervals. The app allows you to select whether you'd like to hear the interval played or see the interval written in staff notation. 

## Problem ##
<!--  > Describe the problem your product solves. -->
  > Interval recognition is a key component of musical training, and is challenging to learn without routine practice. The ability to quickly identify intervals offers a distinct advantage for aspiring musicians, composers, and theorists. Interval training is often a pain point for young music students, and the feeling that you cannot practice without an instructor nearby makes development even more difficult. 

## Solution ##
<!-- > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem. -->
  > PitchDiff provides a way to autonomously develop your interval chops and gain confidence in your ability to read and hear intervals accurately. It elminiates the need to practice with another person, thereby alleviating potential discomfort for beginners who are hesitant to practice in front of others. 

## Quote ##
<!-- > A quote from a spokesperson in your company. -->
  > "I studied music for a long time, and I still suck at intervals. PitchDiff will save me."

## How to Get Started ##
<!-- > Describe how easy it is to get started. -->
  > Check out the app at < url here >. 

## Customer Quote ##
<!-- > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit. -->
  >  "I'm a totally real customer who had a real experience with this product that was positive. PitchDiff is disrupting things."

## Closing and Call to Action ##
<!-- > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next. -->
