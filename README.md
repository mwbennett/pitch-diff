# PitchDiff #
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). 

## Interval Training for Musicians and Composers ##
<!-- > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title. -->
  > Train your eyes and ears to recognize musical intervals quickly and accurately. 

## Summary ##
<!-- > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good. -->
  > PitchDiff helps you improve your ability to quickly and accurately recognize intervals. The app allows you to hear an interval played aloud and see the interval written in staff notation. 

  > Interval recognition is a key component of musical training, and is challenging to learn without routine practice. The ability to quickly identify intervals offers a distinct advantage for aspiring musicians, composers, and theorists. Interval training is often a pain point for young music students, and the feeling that you cannot practice without an instructor nearby makes development even more difficult. 

  > PitchDiff provides a way to autonomously develop your interval chops and gain confidence in your ability to read and hear intervals accurately. It elminiates the need to practice with another person, thereby alleviating potential discomfort for beginners who are hesitant to practice in front of others. 

## How to Get Started ##
